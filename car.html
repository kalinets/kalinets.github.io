			<h2>Marussia B2</h2>

			<p>The B2 is the B1's successor, first shown to the public at the 2009 Frankfurt Motor Show. The differences between the B1 and the B2 are only cosmetic; the B2 offers a new, edgier design and a new, almost space-age interior. The design was meant to give the car a more aggressive look. Some design features include highlighting the grille and intakes in black to contrast them to the car's body colour and emphasize some of the car's geometric elements, as well as styling the car's face to the shape of the "M" in the Marussia Motors logo. Engine power is 420 hp, 309 kW, top speed 310 km/h and acceleration 0–100 km/h in 3.8 seconds. In late 2012, the B2 was featured in the video game Need for Speed: Most Wanted (a Criterion Game).</p>
			<p>In March 2012, Finnish contract manufacturer of specialty automobiles, Valmet Automotive, and Marussia Motors entered into an agreement on production of Marussia B2 sports cars at the Valmet car factory in Uusikaupunki, Finland. A total of 500 units were made, which has been sold out in 2012.</p>

			<h3>Plans and prospects</h3>
			<p>Marussia Motors had stated that it was its intention to open at least two new showrooms in 2011, with London and Monaco named as probable locations. The company wished to market its cars to large European countries and some in Asia and Australia within several years, with the United States to follow. Planned steps to support this included manufacturing vehicles in Western Europe and increasing its product range. Marussia Motors anticipated presenting 7 models at the 2011 Frankfurt Motor Show that were to include a new sports coupé, a luxury SUV, a luxury sedan, and a small city car. However, owing to their discontinuation in 2014, the projects never came to fruition. Its legacy in F1 also lasted for two years, after the respective team folded in 2014.</p>
